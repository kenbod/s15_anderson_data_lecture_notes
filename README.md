# Lecture Notes for Data Engineering in Spring 2015

## Lecture 1

Prof. Anderson is asking us to create a repo on GitHub and take notes in Markdown. I'm not sure how I feel about this.

## Lecture 2

Dustin's Markdown lecture

Markdown is "yet another" markup language. That allows you to edit web document using plain text and then automatically converts the markdown text into HTML. You can easily specify things that will become stylized text (bold, italic, links, tables) and they become "real" elements in the generated HTML.

GitHub adds syntax to Markdown to add special features.

Dustin provides a great set of example.

Headers: six levels specified by pound signs. H1 and H2 on Github have dividers that appear in the formatted HTML.

Lists: Use * for unordered lists; numbers for numbered lists.

Links: Start with square brackets [] Then the link appears in (); You can add hover text via "" after the URL.

Tables, Horizontal Lines.... oh my!
